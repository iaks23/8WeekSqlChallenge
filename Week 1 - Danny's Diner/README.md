## What's Cooking? 🍜 <a name="what's-cooking"></a>

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.


## Problem Statement 🔨 <a name="problem-statement"></a>

Danny wants you to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite.

Danny would then use this data to provide his customers with a more personalized loyalty program which he plans on expanding.

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

---------------

* <code> sales </code>
* <code> menu </code>
* <code> members </code>

---------------

  
# Datasets 💻 <a name="datasets"></a>
 
All datasets exist within the <code> dannys_diner </code> database schema - be sure to include this reference within your SQL scripts as you start exploring the data and answering the case study questions. 
You can find that in my profile under <code> schema.sql </code> file!

Danny's shared 3 key tables for us to work with:
  
  * #### <code> Sales </code>


The <code> sales </code> table captures all <code> customer_id </code> level purchases with an corresponding <code> order_date </code> and <code> product_id </code> information for when and what menu items were ordered.

  * ### <code> Menu </code>

The <code> menu </code> table maps the <code> product_id </code> to the actual <code> product_name </code> and price of each menu item.

  * ### <code> Members </code>

The final <code> members </code> table captures the <code> join_date </code> when a <code> customer_id </code> joined the beta version of the Danny’s Diner loyalty program.


# Case Study Solutions 🔑 <a name="case-study-solutions"></a>
---------------
Danny's got his dream diner running, but boy does he have a lot of questions he wanted answers to. Luckily, I have all of the solutions executed using single line SQL queries.

Let me take you through each of them!

Well, we've come so far, why not help Danny out ust a little more?









Is it just me, or is anybody else really hungry for some ramen? Feedback & suggestions are welcome!
